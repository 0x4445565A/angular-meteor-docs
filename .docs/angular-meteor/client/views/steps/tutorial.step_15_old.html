# Step 15 - Pagination

Now we are dealing with a few parties.
But we need to support also a large number of parties.

In that case, we want to have pagination support.

With pagination we can break the array of parties down to pages so the user won't have to scroll down to find a party,
but also and even more important, we can fetch only a few parties at a time instead of all the parties collection for better performance.

# angular-meteor pagination support

What we want to acheieve with angular-meteor is server-based reactive pagination.
That is no simple task, but using the angular-meteor it could make your life a lot simpler.

To achieve server-based reactive pagination we need to have support for pagination in the server as well as in the client.
That means that our publish function for the parties collection would have to change and also the way that we subscribe to that publication.
So first let's take care of our server-side.

In our parties.js file in the server directory we are going to change the publish method like this:

    Meteor.publish("parties", function (options) {
    ...
    ...
    return Parties.find({
      $or:[
        {$and:[
          {"public": true},
          {"public": {$exists: true}}
        ]},
        {$and:[
          {owner: this.userId},
          {owner: {$exists: true}}
        ]},
        {$and:[
          {invited: this.userId},
          {invited: {$exists: true}}
        ]}
      ]}, options);

Now our publish method receives an options arguments which we then pass to the Parties.find() function call.
This will allow us to send arguments to the find functions' modifier right from the subscribe call. The options object can
contain properties like `skip`, `sort` and `limit` which we will shortly use ourselves.

Let's get back to our client code. We now need to change our subscribe call with options we want to set for pagination.
What are those parameters that we want to set on the options argument? That is a good question. In order to have pagination in our
parties list we will need to save the current page, the number of parties per page and the sort order. So let's add this parameters to our scope
in the partiesList.js file.

    $scope.page = 1;
    $scope.perPage = 3;
    $scope.sort = { name: 1 };

That's cool, but let's do something with these variables expect define them. So where we want to use them is when we call the subscribe method.
And we are also going to use this $scope variables in a reactive way so that when they change our subscription will get recomputed and we will get
the correct data from the server. We can do that like so:

    $meteorUtils.autorun($scope, function() {
      $meteorSubscribe.subscribe('parties', {
        limit: parseInt($scope.getReactively('perPage')),
        skip: (parseInt($scope.getReactively('page')) - 1) * parseInt($scope.getReactively('perPage')),
        sort: $scope.getReactively('sort')
      }).then(function() {
    ....
    ....

What happens here is we are construction an options object that is going to be the modifier for the Parties.find() call.
We set the limit to the perPage we defined as that is the number of parties we want to get. We also set the skip property
to the number of party we want to start with which is the current page minus one times the parties per page, and the last
property we set is the sort order we want to get the parties by. Simple right?

The last part, which is the catchy part, is also adding the sort modifier to the way we get the collection data from the
minimongo. That is because the sorting is not saved when the data is sent from the server to the client. So to make sure our
data is sorted also on the client we can do the following:

    $scope.parties = $meteorCollection(function() {
      return Parties.find({}, {
        sort : $scope.getReactively('sort')
      });
    });

This will allow us to have a sorted array of parties on the client.

# pagination directive

In AngularJS's eco system there are a lot of directive for handling pagination.

Our personal favorite is [angular-utils-pagination](https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/pagination).

To add the directive add it's Meteor package to the project:

    meteor add urigo:angular-utils-pagination

Add it as a dependency to our Angular app in app.js:

    angular.module('socially',[
      'angular-meteor',
      'ui.router',
      'google-maps'.ns(),
      'angularUtils.directives.dirPagination'
    ]);


Now let's add the directive in parties-list.html. change the ng-repeat of parties to this:

    <li dir-paginate="party in parties | itemsPerPage: perPage | filter:search | orderBy:orderProperty"
        class="party" total-items="partiesCount.count">

and after the UL closes add this directive:

    <dir-pagination-controls on-page-change="pageChanged(newPageNumber)"></dir-pagination-controls>

as you can see, dir-paginate list takes the number of objects in array (that we defined before) but also takes the total number items (we will get to that soon).
On the dir-pagination-controls directive there is a method on-page-change and there we can call our own function.

let's create the pageChanged function inside the partiesList.js:

    $scope.pageChanged = function(newPage) {
      $scope.page = newPage;
    };

Now every time we will change the page, the scope variable will change accordingly and update the bind method that watches it.

# Getting total count of a collection

Getting a total count of a collection might seem easy, but there is a problem.
The client only holds the number of object that it subscribed to. that means that if the client is not subscribed to the whole array calling find().count on a collection will result in a partial count.

So we need access in the client for the total count even if we are not subscribed to the whole collection.

For that we can use the [tmeasday:publish-counts](https://github.com/percolatestudio/publish-counts) package. In the command line:

    meteor add tmeasday:publish-counts


That package helps to publish the count of a cursor, in real time without dependency on the subscribe method.

Inside the server -> parties.js file, add the following code inside the Meteor.publish("parties" function, at the beginning of the function. before the existing return statement:

    Counts.publish(this, 'numberOfParties', Parties.find({
      $or:[
        {$and:[
          {"public": true},
          {"public": {$exists: true}}
        ]},
        {$and:[
          {owner: this.userId},
          {owner: {$exists: true}}
        ]},
        {$and:[
          {invited: this.userId},
          {invited: {$exists: true}}
        ]}
    ]}));

Now on the client we have access to the Counts collection. let's subscribe to that in the partiesList.js file:

    $scope.partiesCount = $meteorCollection(Counts)[0];

Now the partiesCount will hold the number of parties and will send it to the directive in the parties-list.html (which we already defined earlier).

Now run the app.
Create lots of parties and see that you can see only 3 at a time and you can scroll between the pages with the directive that populates the number of pages automatically.

# Changing the sort reactively

The last thing we want to do, is to send the sort parameter with the options reactively,
because with pagination it can affect which documents will be sent to the client.

So in the HTML template, let's change the values of the sorting dropdown:

    <option value="1">Ascending</option>
    <option value="-1">Descending</option>

and remove the sorting filter from dir-paginate:

    <li dir-paginate="party in parties | itemsPerPage: perPage | filter:search"


in the controller lets associate that dropdown to $scope.sort:

    $scope.$watch('orderProperty', function(){
      if ($scope.orderProperty)
        $scope.sort = {name: parseInt($scope.orderProperty)};
    });

and also initialize it at the beginning:

    $scope.sort = { name: 1 };
    $scope.orderProperty = '1';

and remove the following line of code (old initialization):

    $scope.orderProperty = 'name';

Now we don't have to do anything other than that. $scope.getReactively will take care of updating the subscription for us
when the sort changes. So all we have left is to sit back and enjoy out pagination working like a charm.

We made a lot of changes so please check the step's code [here](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-angular-socially/compare/step_14...step_15)
to make sure you have everything needed and run the application.

# Reactive Search

Now that we have the basis for pagination, all we have left is to add reactive server-side searching of parties. That means
that we will be able to enter a search string and have the app search for parties that match that name in the server and
return only the relevant results! That is pretty awesome, and we are going to do all that only in several lines of code. So
let's get started.

As before, let's add the server side support. We need to add a new argument to our publish method which will hold the
requested search string. We will call it..... searchString! Here it goes:

    Meteor.publish("parties", function (options, searchString) {

Yep that was simple. Now we are going to filter the correct results using mongo's regex ability. We are going to add this
line at two places where we are using `find`:

    'name' : { '$regex' : '.*' + searchString || '' + '.*', '$options' : 'i' },

As you can see this will filter all the parties with a name that contains the searchString. Now let's move on to the client
side.

We already have a search input in our template. And it is bound to the `search` ng-model. Which means we have the $scope.search
variable available. Remove the lines that had to do with filtering before:

    $scope.filteredParties = $scope.parties;

    $scope.$watch("search", function(search){
      $scope.filteredParties = $filter("filter")($scope.parties, search);
    });

And all we have left to do is call the subscribe method with our reactive scope variable:

    $meteorSubscribe.subscribe('parties', {
      limit: parseInt($scope.getReactively('perPage')),
      skip: (parseInt($scope.getReactively('page')) - 1) * parseInt($scope.getReactively('perPage')),
      sort: $scope.getReactively('sort')
    }, $scope.getReactively('search')).then(function() {

Wow that is all that is needed to have a fully reactive search with pagination! Quite amazing right?

# Summary

Now we have full pagination of client and server side with the help of Meteor's options and Angular's directives.
