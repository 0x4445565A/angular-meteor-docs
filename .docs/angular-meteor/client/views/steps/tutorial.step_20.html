In this step we are going to add the ability to upload images into our app, and also sorting and naming them.

Angular-Meteor provides us with the [$meteor.collectionFS API](/api/files) that wraps [CollectionFS](https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS).

[CollectionFS](https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS) is a suite of Meteor packages that together provide a complete file management solution including uploading, downloading, storage, synchronization, manipulation, and copying.

It supports several storage adapters for saving to the local filesystem, GridFS, or S3, and additional storage adapters can be created.

So assuming you already have an Angular-Meteor project, we will starting by adding CollectionFS to our project by running the following command:
```
meteor add cfs:standard-packages
```

Now, we will decide the the storage adapter we want to use. CollectionFS provides adapters for many popular storage methods, link FileSystem, GridFS, Amazon S3 and DropBox.
In this example, we will use the GridFS as storage adapters, so we will add the adapter adapter by running this command:
```
meteor add cfs:gridfs
```
Node: you can find more information about Stores and Storage Adapters on the CollectionFS's GitHub repository.

So now we have the CollectionFS support and the storage adapter - we need to create a CollectionFS object to handle our files.
Note that you will need to define the collection as shared resource because you will need to use the collection in noth client and server side.

I create the model.js file, and define a regular CollectionFS object called "Images":
```
Images = new FS.Collection("images", {
    stores: [
      new FS.Store.GridFS("original")
    ],
    filter: {
      allow: {
        contentTypes: ['image/*']
      }
    }
});
```

So now we have the collection, we need to create a client-side that handles the images upload.
Note: you can use basic HTML `<input type="file">`  or any other package as you want - you only need the HTML5 File object to be provided.

So now we wil create `example.ng.hmtl` "client" directory with a basic usage of HTML File input inside it:
```
    <div ng-controller="ExampleCtrl">
      <input type="file" id="upload-file">
    </div>
``

No we need to create the main logic in our `example.js`, we will liste to "change" event on the File input and add the image to collection:
 ```
angular.module('example', ['angular-meteor']);

angular.module('example').controller('ExampleCtrl', ['$scope', function ($scope) {
  $('#upload-file').bind("change", function (event) {
    // TODO: Save the image
  });
}]);
```

Great! Now all we have to to is to use $meteorCollectionFS in order to get the CollectionFS we created.
Note that the API of $meteorCollectionFS is the same of $meteorCollection, the only difference is that $meteorCollectionFS works with HTML File object.
```
angular.module('example').controller('ExampleCtrl', function ($meteor, $scope) {
  $scope.images = $scope.$meteorCollectionFS(Images, false, Images);

  $scope.addImages = function (files) {
    $scope.images.save(files);
  };
});
```

And that's it! Now the file is uploaded!
We can easily use ng-repeat or any other code to display our list, and use `url()` method to get the image url, for example:
```
    <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>File Name</th>
        <th>Thumbnail</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr ng-repeat="image in images">
        <td>{{image.original.name}}</td>
        <td><img class="thumbnail" ng-src="{ { image.url() } }"></td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
```
You can see the full example in the Angular-Meteor repository, under examples/collectionfs.
No we will talk about some more abilities that we can add to our Images Upload page, many of them are the result of using AngularJS directives and Angular-Meteor.

# #1: Drag-and-Drop
We can use AngularJS directives that handles file upload and gives us more abilities such as drag & drop, file validation on the client side and some more.
In this example, I will use [ng-file-upload](https://github.com/danialfarid/ng-file-upload), which have many features for file upload.
In order to do this, lets add the package to our project:
```
meteor add danialfarid:ng-file-upload
```

Now, lets add a dependency to our module:
```
angular.module('example', ['angular-meteor', 'ngFileUpload']);
```

And just like in the directive's documentation, we will add an upload object to our HTML instead of regular File Input:
```
<div ngf-drop ngf-select
  ngf-change="addImages($files)"
  ngf-drag-over-class="{accept:'dragover', reject:'dragover-err', delay:100}" class="drop-box"
  ngf-multiple="false" ngf-allow-dir="false" ngf-accept="'image/*'"
  ngf-drop-available="dropAvailable">
    <div>Click here to select image</div>
    <div>
      <strong>OR</strong>
    </div>
    <div ng-show="dropAvailable">You can also drop image to here</div>
</div>
```

Also, in order to make the "drop-zone" look like a dropable area in my page, I added this CSS in `example.css` file:
```
.drop-box {
  background: #F8F8F8;
  border: 5px dashed #DDD;
  width: 230px;
  height: 65px;
  text-align: center;
  padding-top: 25px;
  margin-left: 10px;
}

.drop-box.dragover {
  border: 5px dashed blue;
}

.drop-box.dragover-err {
  border: 5px dashed red;
}
```

I also used ngfChange attribute to know when the user chooses a file, the callback is addImages($files), so lets add this to our `example.js` file instead of using "change" event:
```
$scope.addImages = function (files) {
  $scope.images.save(files);
};
```

And that's it! now we can upload images by using drag and drop!
You can find the full code of this example under Angular-Meteor repository, in the examples/drag-and-drop-image-upload directory.

# #2: Metadata
Using CollectionFS, we can also save metadata on the files we store.
In order to to that, we just need to add the name of the property to the File object before we upload it.

A common example for metadata for images is description. let's see how we can do that.

## Add Description
Using CollectionFS, we can set any metadata on our File object, and then save in on the collection.
In order to do that really nice and user-friendly, I used [angular-xeditable](https://github.com/vitalets/angular-xeditable).
Lets add the angular-xeditable package to our project:
```
meteor add vitalets:angular-xeditable
```
And add a dependency in our module:
```
angular.module('example', ['angular-meteor', 'ngFileUpload', 'xeditable']);
```

Now, lets add some more style to our table, by creating a tile for each image (instead of table), with "Description" under it:
```
// example.ng.html
<div class="images-tiles-container">
  <div ng-repeat="image in images" class="image-tile">
    <button ng-click="removeImage(image)" class="delete-button">X</button>
    <img class="thumbnail" ng-src="{ { image.url() } }"><br />
  </div>
</div>

// Add to example.css
.image-tile {
  float: left;
  position: relative;
  border: 1px solid cadetblue;
  margin-right: 30px;
  padding: 5px;
}

.delete-button {
  position: absolute;
  top: 5px;
  left: 5px;
  background-color: white;
}
```

And now lets add under the `img` tag the xeditable:
```
<img class="thumbnail" ng-src="{ { image.url() } }"><br />
<a href="#" editable-text="image.metadata.description" onbeforesave="updateDescription($data, image)">{ { image.metadata.description || 'No Description' } }</a>
```
We will use the angular-xeditable ability to notify us and run a callback when the value changes, using `onbeforesave` attribute. The function will receive with the `$data` (the xeditable value) and `image` which is the current image.
So lets implement the updateDescription method on our $scope. We will use the ability to run `update` function on CollectionFS File objects, and use `$set` to update our metadata, for more ways of doing it, you can read [this](https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS/wiki/How-to:-Update-existing-file's-metadata) in CollectionFS wiki.
```
$scope.updateDescription = function($data, image) {
  image.update({$set: {'metadata.description': $data}});
};
```

That's it! Now we have a photo gallery with description for each image!
You can find the full code of this example under Angular-Meteor repository, in the examples/collectionfs-metadata directory.

## Order Images
After we learned how to use CollectionFS metadata and how to update metadata values, we can also add an ability to sort and update the images order.
To get the ability to sort the images, let's use [angular-sortable-view](https://github.com/kamilkp/angular-sortable-view).

Add the package by running this command:
```
meteor add netanelgilad:angular-sortable-view
```
And then add a dependency for the module:
```
angular.module('example', ['angular-meteor', 'ngFileUpload', 'xeditable', 'angular-sortable-view']);
```

The basics of angular-sortable-view is to add the `sv-?` attributes to our page, just like the examples in the `angular-sortable-view` repository, So let's do that:
```
    <div class="images-tiles-container" sv-root sv-part="images" sv-on-sort="updateOrder($indexFrom, $indexTo)">
      <div ng-repeat="image in images" class="image-tile" sv-element>
        <button ng-click="removeImage(image)" class="delete-button">X</button>
        <img draggable="false" class="thumbnail" ng-src="{ { image.url()} }">
        <!-- ... some more code ... -->
      </div>
    </div>
```
I use the `sv-on-sort` callback to know when the sort is done and which image moved to which position.
Now let's implement the $scope function that will create and move the objects, this function orders the item in the new order and moves the items as needed.
```
$scope.updateOrder = function(indexFrom, indexTo) {
  var imagesOrder = [];

  angular.forEach($scope.images, function (image, index) {
    image.metadata.order = index + 1;
    imagesOrder.push({image: image, order: image.metadata.order});
  });

  var moved = $scope.images.splice(indexTo, 1)[0];
  $scope.images.splice(indexFrom, 0, moved);

  _.forEach(imagesOrder, function(imageOrder) {
    imageOrder.image.update({ $set: { 'metadata.order': imageOrder.order } });
  });
};
```

And now let's add the actual order for the display by modifying the subscription of the collection:
```
$scope.images = $scope.$meteorCollectionFS(function() {
  return Images.find({}, {sort: [['metadata.order', 'asc']]})
}, false);
```

That's it! Now we have a photo gallery with the ability to sort our images!
You can find the full code of this example under Angular-Meteor repository, in the examples/collectionfs-sortable directory.

# #3: Edit image before save
One of the most common actions we want to make with pictures is edit it before saving, we will add to our example ability to crop images before uploading them to the server.
In this example, we will use [ngImgCrop](https://github.com/alexk111/ngImgCrop/) which provides us the ability to do that.
So lets start by adding the package to our project:
```
meteor add alexk111:ng-img-crop
```
And add a dependency in our module:
```
angular.module('example', ['angular-meteor', /*...*/, 'ngImgCrop']);
```
We want to perform the crop in the client side only, before saving it in the CollectionFS, so lets get the uploaded image, and instead of saving it in the server - we will get the Data Url of it, and use it in the ngImgCrop:
```
$scope.addImages = function (files) {
  if (files.length > 0) {
    var reader = new FileReader();

    reader.onload = function (e) {
      $scope.$apply(function() {
        $scope.imgSrc = e.target.result;
        $scope.myCroppedImage = '';
      })
    };

    reader.readAsDataURL(files[0]);
  }
  else {
    $scope.imgSrc = undefined;
  }
};
```
We take the file object and used HTML5 FileReader API to read the file from the user on the client side, without uploading it to the server.
Then we saved the DataURI of the image into a $scope variable.
Next, we will need to use this DataURI with the ngImgCrop direcrtive as follow, and lets add a button that runs a $scope function to save the image:
```
<div ng-if="imgSrc" class="ng-crop-container">
  <img-crop image="imgSrc" result-image="$parent.myCroppedImage" area-type="square"></img-crop>
  <button ng-click="saveCroppedImage()">Save</button>
</div>
```
So now we have a upload button which give the user ability to pick a image and then edit and crop it, all we have to do is save it.
In order to save, we need to implement `saveCroppedImage()` function. We will use the same `$meteorCollectionFS` API we used before, just use the `save` function.
CollectionFS have the ability to receive DataURI and save it, just like a File object. So the implementation looks like that:
```
$scope.saveCroppedImage = function() {
  if ($scope.myCroppedImage !== '') {
    $scope.images.save($scope.myCroppedImage)
  }
};
```

And we are done! Now we have the ability to crop images and then save them using CollectionFS.
You can find the full code of this example under Angular-Meteor repository, in the examples/collectionfs-crop directory.

# #4: Image Thumbnails
Another common usage with images upload, is the ability to save thumbnails of the image as soon as we upload it.
CollectionFS gives the ability to handle multiple Stores object, and perform manipulations before we save it in each store.
You can find the full information about image manipulation in the [CollectionFS docs](https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS#image-manipulation).
Also, make sure you add `meteor add cfs:graphicsmagick` and install graphicsmagick, for more information, follow the instructions on the CollectionFS GitHub page.
So in order to add ability to save thumbnails, lets add a new store in the `model.js` and use `transformWrite` ability:
```
Images = new FS.Collection("images", {
  stores: [
    new FS.Store.GridFS("original"),
    new FS.Store.GridFS("thumbnail", {
      transformWrite: function(fileObj, readStream, writeStream) {
        gm(readStream, fileObj.name()).resize('32', '32', '!').stream().pipe(writeStream);
      }
    })
  ],
  filter: {
    allow: {
      contentTypes: ['image/*']
    }
  }
});
```
So now each image we upload will be saved also as thumbnail.
All we have to do is use and display the thumbnail instead of the original image. We just need to add a param to `url()` method of File objects and decide which Store to use when creating the URL:
```
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Thumbnail</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr ng-repeat="image in images">
    <td><a href="" ui-sref=".image({imageId: image._id})">{{image.original.name}}</a></td>
    <td><a target="_blank" ng-href="{ { image.url({store: 'original'}) } }"><img ng-src="{ { image.url({store: 'thumbnail'}) } }"></a></td>
    <td><button ng-click="removeImage(image)">X</button></td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```
That's it! Now we added the ability to save thumbnails for the images and use them in the view!
You can find the full code of this example under Angular-Meteor repository, in the examples/collectionfs-thumbnails directory.
