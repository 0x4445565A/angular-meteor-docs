    <p>
      The purpose of this tutorial is to start from the beginning of writing applications with Meteor and Angularjs.
      This tutorial is good whether you have previous knowledge in one of those frameworks and also if you don't.
      We will try to take the best tutorials of the 2 frameworks and combine them into one broad tutorial.
      This tutorial will walk you through construction of a Meteor-Angular app.
      You will build a list of friends, that you can also filter, dive into their profiles for more details
      and of course store it all in a server and sync the information between clients with different users in real time.
