    <h1>Step 0</h1>
    <p>
      You are now ready to build the Meteor-Angular socially app.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this step, you will become familiar with the most important source code files,
      learn how to start the Meteor server, connect an AngularJS FrontEnd to it and run the application in the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      First step - let's install Meteor!
    </p>
    <p>
      Open your command line and paste this command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      <span class="pln">$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Now let's create our app - write this in the command line:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      <span class="pln">$ meteor create socially</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Now let's see what we got.  go into the folder:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      <span class="pln">$ cd socially</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      and run the app like so:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      <span class="pln">$ meteor</span>
      <span class="pln"></span>
      <span class="pln">=> Started proxy.</span>
      <span class="pln">=> Started MongoDB.</span>
      <span class="pln">=> Started your app.</span>
      <span class="pln">=> App running at: http://localhost:3000/</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now go to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>
      and look at the amazing app that's running on your computer!
    </p>
    <p>So, as you can see, we have a full running app! which includes a server and a client.</p>
    <p>But let's start from the beginning, please delete to following files:</p>
    <pre><code>
      <span class="pln">socially.css	socially.html	socially.js</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now we can start building our app.  first let's create a new index.html file and place this code inside and run the app again:</p>

    <pre><code class="lang-html">
      <span class="tag">&lt;body&gt;</span><span class="pln">

        </span><span class="tag">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="pln">Nothing here</span><span class="tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span><span class="pln">

      </span><span class="tag">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
<do-nothing>
{{#markdown}}

As you can see, there is no html tag, no head tag, very simple..


  
the reason is the way Meteor structuring and serving the files to the client.

Meteor scans all the HTML files in your application and concatenates them together.

It will create the HTML, HEAD and BODY tags by itself and place in there everything it needs to run the app.

Then it will search for all the HTML files containing HEAD or BODY tags and concatenate their content into the main file.



So in our case, Meteor found our index.html file, found the BODY tag inside and added it's content to the main generated file's BODY tag.

(right-click -> inspect element on the page to see the generated file)



Now it's time to add AngularJS to our stack!

Now first things first, let's add the AngularJS package to Meteor (we will discuss more about Meteor packages later in this tutorial)



back in the command line, launch this command:

    $ meteor add urigo:ngmeteor

This package takes care of including the latest AngularJS library code into our app.

That's it! now we can use the AngularJS power in our Meteor app.

Let's start simple - change the P tag so that index.html file will look like this:


__`index.html`:__

    <body>
      <p>Nothing here [[ 'yet' + '!' ]]</p>
    </body>

# What is the code doing?
Double-square-brackets binding with an expression:

    Nothing here [['yet' + '!']]

This line demonstrates two core features of Angular's templating capabilities:

* A binding, denoted by Double-square-brackets [[ ]]
* a simple expression 'yet' + '!' used in this binding.

AngularJS is finding those Double-square-brackets, evaluates the expression and insert the result into the DOM in place of the binding.
Rather than a one-time insert, as we'll see in the next steps, a binding will result in efficient continuous updates whenever the result of the expression evaluation changes.
Inside in the client side, like a future smart browser would do.


> You can see that we are using Double-square-brackets instead of double-curlies.
>
> That is because Meteor templating system uses double-curlies and if we will use them Meteor will override Angular.
>
> Fortunatly Angular (unlike Meteor..) gives us the option to change the double-curlies to Double-square-brackets.
>
> But you don't need to do anything, urigo:ngmeteor takes care of that for you.


# Experiments
Try adding a new expression to the index.html that will do some math:

    <p>1 + 2 = [[ 1 + 2 ]]</p>

# Summary
Now let's go to [step 1](step_01) and add some content to the web app.
