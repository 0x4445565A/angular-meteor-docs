# Step 12 - Conditional template directives with AngularJS

AngularJS has great and very simple directives that help us show and hide DOM elements conditionally.
You can bind them to an expression, variables or functions.

# ng-show and ng-hide

First, let's learn about [ng-show](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngShow) and [ng-hide](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngHide).

So one thing we want to hide and show is the form for creating a new party. if the user is not logged in, he can't create a party, so why displaying the form for him?
If the user is not logged in we want to display a message saying he needs to log in to create a new party.

In parties-list.html add a ng-show directive to the form like that:

    <form ng-show="user">

'user' is the scope variable that we used earlier that is binded to the current logged in user with the help of the $user service.
If it is undefined is means that there is no logged in user so only if it exists the form will be shown.

Then right after the form add this HTML:

      <div ng-hide="user">
        Log in to create a party!
      </div>

That is exactly the opposite - if user exists, hide that div. note that this statement is equivalent to ng-show="!user".

Let's add the same to the RSVP buttons:

      <div ng-show="user">
        <input type="button" value="I'm going!" ng-click="rsvp(party._id, 'yes')">
        <input type="button" value="Maybe" ng-click="rsvp(party._id, 'maybe')">
        <input type="button" value="No" ng-click="rsvp(party._id, 'no')">
      </div>


Next thing we want to hide is the delete party option in case the logged in user is not the party's owner.
Lets add ng-show to the delete button like that:

    <button ng-click="remove(party)" ng-show="user && user._id == party.owner">X</button>

In here you can see that ng-show can get a statement, in our case - the user exists (logged in) and is also the party's owner.


# ng-if

[ng-if](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngIf) acts almost the same as ng-show but the difference between them
is that ng-show hides the element by changing the display css property and ng-if simply removes it from the DOM completely.

So lets use ng-if to hide the outstanding invitations from a party is the party is public (everyone is invited!):

    <ul ng-if="!party.public">
      Users who not responded:
      <li ng-repeat="invitedUser in outstandingInvitations(party)">
        [[ invitedUser | displayName ]]
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div ng-if="party.public">
      Everyone is invited
    </div>


# Assigning a function

Now lets hide the 'Users to invite' inside party-details.html is case the user is not logged in or can't invite to the party:

To do that we will create a scope function that returns a boolean and associate it hide ng-show:

Create a new function inside partyDetailsCtrl inside the partyDetails.js file named 'canInvite':

    $scope.canInvite = function (){
      if (!$scope.party)
        return false;

      return !$scope.party.public &&
        $scope.party.owner === Meteor.userId();
    };

and add the ng-show to the 'ul' in party-details.html:

      <ul ng-show="canInvite()">
        Users to invite:
        <li ng-repeat="user in users | uninvited:party">
          <div>[[ user | displayName ]]</div>
          <button ng-click="invite(user)">Invite</button>
        </li>
      </ul>

Now lets add a div that tells to the user that everyone is already invite if he invited all the users already:

      <ul ng-show="canInvite()">
        Users to invite:
        <li ng-repeat="user in users | uninvited:party">
          <div>[[ user | displayName ]]</div>
          <button ng-click="invite(user)">Invite</button>
        </li>
        <li ng-if="(users | uninvited:party).length <= 0">
          Everyone are already invited.
        </li>
      </ul>

we are taking the result of the uninvited users and check for it's length.

# ng-disabled

Now lets disable the partyDetails input fields in case the user doesn't have permission to change them (now the server is stopping the user but there is no visual feedback besides that the server overrides the local edit immediately after):

      <input ng-model="party.name" ng-disabled="party.owner != $root.currentUser._id">
      <input ng-model="party.description" ng-disabled="party.owner != $root.currentUser._id">
      <label>Is public</label>
      <input type="checkbox" ng-model="party.public" ng-disabled="party.owner != $root.currentUser._id">


# Summery

So now our example looks much better after we hide things based on the current situation.

In the next chapter we will try to organize the code itself even more with creating our own custom Parties service.
