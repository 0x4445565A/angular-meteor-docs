# Step 10 - Using and creating AngularJS filters

Our next mission is to invite users to private parties.

And we have subscribed to list of all users.  but we can't invite everyone,
we can't invite the owner of the party and we can't invite users who are already invited, so why not filter them out of the view?

To do so we will use AngularJS powerful filter feature.

But before we create our own, let's learn how to use the useful existing filters.

Let's add a search feature to our app.

Add a search input into the parties-list.html file:

    <input type="search" ng-model="search">

and then we will filter the parties array with that. the parties list HTML should look like that:

    <ul>
      Parties:
      <div>
        Search
        <input type="search" ng-model="search">
      </div>
      <li ng-repeat="party in parties | filter:search ">
        <a href="/parties/[[party._id]]">[[party.name]]</a>

        <p>[[party.description]]</p>
        <button ng-click="remove(party)">X</button>
      </li>
    </ul>

That's it!   try to run the app and write a search query in the input field.

So what we did here is appending the parties array with a filter with the parameter search.

Now let's use another filter to order the parties list.

Let's add a select tag that is binded to the sorting way we want:

    <select ng-model="orderProperty">
      <option value="name">Ascending</option>
      <option value="-name">Descending</option>
    </select>

And let's add the orderBy filter with the orderProperty parameter:

    <ul>
      Parties:
      <div>
        Search
        <input type="search" ng-model="search">
        <select ng-model="orderProperty">
          <option value="name">Ascending</option>
          <option value="-name">Descending</option>
        </select>
      </div>
      <li ng-repeat="party in parties | filter:search | orderBy:orderProperty ">
        <a href="/parties/[[party._id]]">[[party.name]]</a>

        <p>[[party.description]]</p>
        <button ng-click="remove(party)">X</button>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>

Add the following line to the partiesListCtrl controller in parties-list.js to initialize the sorting we want to start with:

    $scope.orderProperty = 'name';


Filters can work on array as well as single values.
We can aggregate any number of filters on top of each other.

Here is the list of all of AngularJS built-in filters:
[https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter)

And here is a 3rd party library with many more filters:
[angular-filter](https://github.com/a8m/angular-filter)


Now that we know how to use filters,
let's create a custom filter that will filter out users that are the owners of a certain party and that are already invited to it.

Create a new folder named 'filters' under the client->parties folder.

Under that folder create a new file named uninvited.js and place that code inside:

    angular.module("socially").filter('uninvited', function () {
      return function (users, party) {
        if (!party)
          return false;

        return _.filter(users, function (user) {
          if (user._id == party.owner ||
              _.contains(party.invited, user._id))
            return false;
          else
            return true;
        });
      }
    });

* So first we define a filter to the "socially" module (our app).
* The filter named 'uninvited'
* Filters always get at least one parameter and the first parameter is always the object or array that we are filtering (like the parties in the previous example.
So here we are filtering the users array so that's the first parameter
* The second parameter is the party we want to check
* The first if statement is to make sure we passed the initializing phase of the party and it's not undefined

At this point we need to return the filtered array.

The great thing here is that thanks to Meteor we have access to the great [underscore](http://docs.meteor.com/#underscore) library.

So we use underscore's filter method the check for each user isn't the party's owner or that
he does not already _contains (another underscore method) in the invited list.

So now let's use our new filter

Simply add the filter to the list of users and send the current party to the party parameter, inside party-details.html:

    <ul>
      Users:
      <li ng-repeat="user in users | uninvited:party">
        <div>[[ user.emails[0].address ]]</div>
      </li>
    </ul>


Run the app and see the users in each party.

We still don't have invites but you can see that the filter already filters the party owners out of the list.


# Summery

In this chapter we learned about AngularJS filters and how easy they are to use and to read from the HTML.

In the next step we will learn about Meteor methods, which let's us run more logic in the server then the Mongo API and the allow method.
