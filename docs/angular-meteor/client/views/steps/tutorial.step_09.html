# Step 9 - Privacy and publish-subscribe functions

Right now our app has no privacy, every user can see all the parties on the screen.

So let's add a 'public' flag on parties - if a party is public we will let anyone see it, but if a party if private, only the owner can see it.

First we need to remove the 'autopublish' Meteor package.

autopublish is added to any new Meteor project. it pushed a full copy of the database to each client.
it helped us until now, but it's not so good for privacy...

Write this command in the consle:

    meteor remove autopublish


Now run the app.   You can't see any parties.

So now we need to tell Meteor what parties should it publish to the clients.

To do that we will use Meteor's publish command.

Publish functions should go only in the server so the client won't have access to them.
So let's create a new file named parties.js inside the server folder.

Inside the file insert this code:

    Meteor.publish("parties", function () {
      return Parties.find({
        $or:[
          {$and:[
            {"public": true},
            {"public": {$exists: true}}
          ]},
          {$and:[
            {owner: this.userId},
            {owner: {$exists: true}}
          ]}
        ]});
    });

Let's see what is happening here.

First, we have the Meteor.publish - a function to define what to publish from the server to the client.

The first parameter is the name of the subscription. the client will subscribe to that name.

The second parameter is a function the defines what will be returned in the subscription.
That function will determine what data will be returned and the permissions needed.

So in our case the first name parameter is "parties". so in the client we will need to subscribe to the "parties" collection.

We already doing that by setting true in the 4th parameter of the $collection.bind function.

if we wanted to subscribe to a different name then the collection name itself - "parties" we would set that parameter with the subscription name like that:

    $collection(Parties).bind($scope, 'parties', true, 'publicPartiesSubscription');



In the second parameter, our function uses the Mongo API to return the wanted documents (document are the JSON-style data structure of MongoDB).

So we create a query - start with the find method on the Parties collection.

Inside the find method we use the [$or](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query/or/), [$and](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query/and/) and [$exists](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query/exists/) Mongo operators to pull our wanted parties:

Or that the owner parameter exists and it's the current logged in user (which we have access to with the command this.userId), or that the party's public flag exists and it's set as true.


So now let's add the public flag to the parties and see how does it affect the parties the client gets.

Let's add a checkbox to the new party form in parties-list.html:

    <label>Public</label>
    <input type="checkbox" ng-model="newParty.public">

Notice how easy it is to bind a checkbox to a model with AngularJS!

Let's add the same to the party-details.html page:

    <label>Is public</label>
    <input type="checkbox" ng-model="party.public">

Now let's run the app.

Log in with 2 different users in 2 different browsers.

In each of the users create a few public parties and a few private ones.

Now log out and see which user sees which parties.


# Summery

We've added the support of privacy to our parties app.

We also learned how to use the Meteor.publish command to control the data and permissions sent to the client
and how to subscribe to it with the $collection.bind 4th parameter.

In the next step we will learn about Meteor methods, which let's us run more logic in the server then the Mongo API and the allow method.
